#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) - value of a will increase as the size of n  will increase, this will increase the while loop condition to run the loop


b)O(n^2) - there are two loops that depend on the size of n


c)0(n) - recursion of the function depend on the size of n
